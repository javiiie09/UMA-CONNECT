# UMA-CONNECT

It's a social network attempt, created for an university project.
Actually it use a local database for storage all the users with their information. It is incomplete, the chat and some filters are missing.


The objective is get the application in a web server with a persistent database and with all the functions we initially proposed.

It's fully made with Java and the Spring-boot framework, and the database runs behind H2.
